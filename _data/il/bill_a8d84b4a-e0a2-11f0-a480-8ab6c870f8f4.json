Provides that each academic year the board of trustees of each public university shall offer a full-tuition waiver for undergraduate education at any campus under the board's governance or supervision to any Illinois resident who: (i) was serving in the Illinois National Guard, the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Navy, the United States Air Force, the United States Space Force, or a Reserve Officers' Training Corps program related to any of these armed service branches and was relying on full-tuition or partial-tuition assistance to complete the person's undergraduate education; (ii) has been discharged from service, either forcibly or by being given the choice of voluntary discharge or forced discharge, due to changes in federal policy leading to that person's discharge for reasons unrelated to performance; and (iii) has lost that tuition assistance prior to completion of the person's undergraduate education. Provides that to be eligible to receive a waiver, the individual must: (i) apply for the waiver; (ii) provide documentary proof of service, of prior tuition assistance, and of discharge; and (iii) qualify for admission to the university under the same admission requirements, standards, and policies that the university applies to applicants for admission generally to the university's respective undergraduate colleges and programs. Provides that an eligible applicant who has continued to maintain satisfactory academic progress toward graduation may have the individual's waiver renewed until the individual has expended 4 years of undergraduate full-tuition benefits. Requires the board to adopt rules as necessary for implementation and administration."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
