Acknowledges that the most effective instrument for the protection of democracy and civil liberties in the last nine months has been litigation, and that the Attorney General and his team have been incredibly effective in their defense of the State's democracy. Recognizes the Office of the Illinois Attorney General's filing of a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop the unlawful deployment of the National Guard in Illinois, challenging federal invocation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406, the Posse Comitatus Act, and the Tenth Amendment, is a case of national significance in protecting state sovereignty and civil liberties.
